# API Project

A Next.js project API is a serverless API that is built using the Next.js framework. It allows you to create API routes that can be used to fetch data from a database or external API, or to perform server-side operations. These API routes can be accessed from the client-side code using HTTP requests. Next.js project APIs are easy to set up and can be deployed to a variety of hosting platforms, including Vercel, AWS Lambda, and Google Cloud Functions.
